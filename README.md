# Hello

I am working on learning the MERN stack and my ulitmate goal is to have a functioning web app.

# What will the app do?

It will allow users to upload their board games to a DB and create game nights with a group of friends. Those groups will then be able to select which games they want to play before hand.

# This is my personal project and will be poking at it for a while :)
